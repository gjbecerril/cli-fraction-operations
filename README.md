# cli-fraction-operations

<p>Prior to executing this file, the following must be done:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A recent version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> has been downloaded and installed</li>
  <li>Add support for CLI arguments in Node by ensuring the yargs module is installed. If it’s not installed, run the command below:
    <p>npm install yargs@13.2</p>
  </li>
  <li>Clone the application from this repo.</li>
  <li>In CLI, navigate to the folder containing the Fractions Operations code.</li>
  <li>Run the Fractions Operations script as follows. Quotes must be included because of issues encountered with the “-” sign.
    <p>node . -? "1/4 + 1/4"</p>
  </li>
</ol>
 <p>These are my test cases. The code results were tested against the same operations performed at <a href="https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/mixednumbers.php">CalculatorSoup</a>. You can copy and paste multiple operation strings to the CLI, just remove the “= ½” part.</p>
